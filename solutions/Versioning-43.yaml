  ## Python Enhancement Proposal 440 ([PEP440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/))


  It is *the* way Python software should be versioned

  * Flexible but complicated

  * Order of release segments is mandated


  Format: `[N!]N(.N)*[{a|b|rc}N][.postN][.devN]`

  1. Optional _epoch segment_: an integer number `N` followed by exclamation mark
  (e.g. `1!`)

  1. __Mandatory__ _release segment_: as many integer numbers `N1`, `N2`, ..., separated
  by `.` (e.g. `1.2.3.4.5`)

  1. Optional _pre-release segment_: one of `a`, `b`, `rc` followed by an integer
  number `N` (e.g. `a1`, `b2`, `rc3`)

  1. Optional _post-release segment_: one `.` followed by `post` and an integer number
  `N` (e.g. `.post1`)

  1. Optional _development release segment_: one `.` followed by `dev` and an integer
  number `N` (e.g. `.dev1`)

question: Suppose your Python project is currently at version `1.2.3`. You rename
  (all usages of) a public class's constructor's parameter name. What should be the
  next version number if this change is going to be released immediately?
see_also:
- The notion of API and what does or does not constitute a change in the API.
- The notion of backward compatibility and its relation to API changes.
- Conventional commits and why this change should be marked as a breaking change (e.g. `feat!`, or `refactor!`).
should:
- Identify that the versioning follows semantic versioning principles, 
  explaining the meaning of the major, minor, and patch version numbers.
- Recognize that renaming a public class's constructor's parameter name is a non-backward-compatible
  change in Python (while it is backward-compatible in other langauges like Java) 
  making it a major version change.
- Argue that the major version  number should be incremented and the other ones should be reset, 
  resulting in version `2.0.0`.
should_not:
- Confuse this as a minor or patch change.
- Argue that the change is backward-compatible in Python, as it is not.
- Forget to reset the minor or patch version numbers when incrementing the major version number.
