- 'A good example of a response: "The command `git add .` stages all modified and
  new files within the current working directory for the next commit, while ignoring
  any files that match patterns in the `.gitignore` file, allowing developers to manage
  which changes are tracked in the Git history."'

- "## Ignoring files\n\nIn general, we do not want to track *all* the files in the\
  \ repository folder:\n* Some files could be *temporary* (e.g., created by the editor)\n\
  * Some files could be *regenerable* (e.g., compiled binaries and application archives)\n\
  * Some files could contain *private* information\n\nOf course, we could just not\
  \ `add` them, but the error is around the corner!\n\nIt would be much better to\
  \ just tell Git to ignore some files.\n\nThis is achieved through a *special `.gitignore`\
  \ file*.\n  * the file must be named `.gitignore`, names like `foo.gitignore` or\
  \ `gitignore.txt` won't work\n    * A good way to create/append to this file is\
  \ via `echo whatWeWantToIgnore >> .gitignore` (multiplatform command)\n  * it is\
  \ a list of paths that git will ignore (unless `git add` is called with the `--force`\
  \ option)\n  * it is possible to add exceptions\n"

- "## Staging\n\nGit has the concept of *stage* (or *index*).\n* Changes must be added\
  \ to the stage to be committed.\n* Commits save the *__changes__ included in the\
  \ stage*\n  * Files changed after being added to the stage neet to be re-staged\n\
  * `git add <files>` moves the current state of the files into the stage as *changes*\n\
  * `git reset <files>` removes currently staged *changes* of the files from stage\n\
  * `git commit` creates a new *changeset* with the contents of the stage\n\n```mermaid\n\
  flowchart LR\nworkdir(\"working directory\") --add--> stage(\"stage (or index)\"\
  ) --commit--> repository(repository)\nstage --reset-->workdir\n```\n"
- "## `.gitattributes`\n\n* A sensible strategy is to use `LF` everywhere, but for\
  \ Windows scripts (`bat`, `cmd`, `ps1`)\n* Git can be configured through a `.gitattributes`\
  \ file in the repository root\n  * It can do [much more than enforcing line endings](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes),\
  \ actually\n* Example:\n```text\n* text=auto eol=lf\n*.[cC][mM][dD] text eol=crlf\n\
  *.[bB][aA][tT] text eol=crlf\n*.[pP][sS]1 text eol=crlf\n```\n"
- "## Initializing a repository\n\n### `git init`\n* Initializes a new repository\
  \ *inside the current directory*\n* Reified in the `.git` folder\n* The location\
  \ of the `.git` folder marks the root of the repository\n  * Do not nest repositories\
  \ inside repositories, it is fragile\n  * Nested projects are realized via *submodules*\
  \ (not discussed in this course)\n* **Beware of the place where you issue the command!**\n\
  \  * First use `cd` to locate yourself inside the folder that contains (or will\
  \ containe the project)\n    * (possibly, first create the folder with `mkdir`)\n\
  \  * **Then** issue `git init`\n  * if something goes awry, you can delete the repository\
  \ by deleting the `.git` folder.\n"

question: What is the purpose of the command `git add .`?
see_also:
- Discuss the staging area in Git and why it is important for organizing commits cleanly.
- Mention best practices regarding what types of files should typically be added or
  ignored in a project.
- Reference the necessity of reviewing changes before committing them, using `git
  status` to see what is staged and ready for commit.
should:
- Explain that `git add .` stages all the changes in the current directory and its
  subdirectories for the next commit.
- Mention that using `.` means all changes across all files will be included except
  those specified in `.gitignore` (if applicable).
- Indicate that this command does not permanently save changes but prepares them for
  commit.
- Provide a brief explanation of staging in Git and the relationship between staging
  and commits.
should_not:
- Avoid stating that the command deletes files or makes changes permanent, as it only
  stages files.
- Do not confuse `git add .` with `git commit`, which actually saves the staged changes
  to the repository.
- Refrain from omitting the importance of the `.gitignore` file and its interactions
  with the `git add` process.
