## Best practices

* The **CLI** is your *truth*
  * Beware of the GUIs
* Prepare an *ignore list* early
  * And *maintain it*
  * And maybe prepare it manually and don't copy/paste it
* When you have untracked files, *decide whether you want to track them or ignore them*
* Be very careful with *what* you track
* Prepare an *attribute file*
* *Pull* before pushing
