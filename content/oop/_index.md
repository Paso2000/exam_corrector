# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

{{% import path="reusable/header.md" %}}

---

## Many programming paradigms

(cf. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm>)

- **Imperative programming**: programs are made by __instructions__ that change the state of the program.
- **Procedural programming**: programs are made by __blocks__ of code that can be reused.
- **Functional programming**: programs are made by __functions__ that transform data.
- **Logic programming**: programs are made by __rules__ that define relationships between data.
- **Object-oriented programming**: programs are made by __objects__ that interact with each other.

## Why object-oriented programming?

(cf. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming>)

- **By far** the _most used_ programming paradigm nowadays, both in industry and academia
- **Fundamental** for understanding _modern_ programming languages, and their _libraries_
- Most commonly, the __design__ phase of SE involves designing _objects_, and their _behaviours_, and their _interactions_

--- 

## Three dimensions of software design

- **Structure**: how is the software _organised_? how is _information_ organized?
- **Behaviour**: what does the software _do_? how does it transform _data_?
- **Interaction**: how/when do different pieces of software _communicate_ to _cooperate_?

## Key principles of OOP

- __Everything__ is an _object_

- A __program__ is a _bunch of objects_ telling each other what to do by __sending messages__

- Every object can have its own __memory__ (state) composed by other objects

- Every object is an _instance_ of a __class__

- Every object has an __interface__, which defines what messages it can receive
    + and so what the __type__ of the object is

---

## Key principles of OOP, in practice

- An object is a _container_ of __attributes__. These can be of 3 sorts:
    * __fields__, i.e. _variables_ that store object-specific _data_ 
        + (these constitute the aforementioned memory/state)
    * __methods__, i.e. _functions_ that can read/write the other members of the object 
        + (these constitute the aforementioned "messages that can be received" by the object)
    * __properties__, i.e. methods that can be accessed _as if_ they were fields

- Classes are _blueprints_ for objects
    + they describe what _attributes_ an object will have
    + each __member__ of a class defines an _attribute_ that _all_ objects of that class will have

- Objects are __created__ as _instances_ of classes
    + each class has a _constructor_, i.e. a magic function which creates an _instance_ of the class
    + the constructor is in charge of _initializing_ the object's _attributes_

- Objects can __use__ _other objects_, by _calling_ their methods or _accessing_ their fields or properties
    + (this is what the aforementioned "sending messages" is about)
    + the _data_ stored in objects' fields are indeed _other objects_
    + the _methods_ of an object are functions which can accept as _arguments_, and return them as _results_

## Example: the `Light` class

{{% multicol %}}
{{% col %}}
### Class definition
```python
class Light:
    def __init__(self, initially_on: bool):
        self.state = initially_on

    @property
    def is_off(self) -> bool:
        return not self.state

    @is_off.setter
    def is_off(self, value: bool):
        self.state = not value

    def switch(self):
        self.state = not self.state

    def to_string(self) -> str:
        return f"Light(state={'on' if self.state else 'off'})"
```
### Usage
```python
l = Light(True)
print(l.to_string()) # Light(state=on)
l.switch()
print(l.to_string()) # Light(state=off)
l.state = True
print(l.to_string()) # Light(state=on)
l.is_off = True
print(l.to_string()) # Light(state=off)
print(l.is_off) # True
```
{{% /col %}}
{{% col %}}
### Aspects to notice

Object of type `Light` have:

-  a __field__ `state` _storing_ a _boolean_
    + which is `True` if that light is on, `False` otherwise  

- a _settable_ __property__ `is_off` corresponding to the opposite of `state`

- a __method__ `switch` that toggles the `state` of the light

- a constructor `__init__` that initializes the `state` of the light to its initial value (`initially_on`)
    + this is invoked via the name of the class, e.g. `Light)`

{{% /col %}}

--- 

## What is `self`?

- You can think about a class as group of functions, which all have an _implicit_ first argument, `self`
    + this is a reference to the _instance_ of the class that is being manipulated
    + it is _not_ passed explicitly when calling the method

- Via `self`, you can access the _other attributes_ of an object, from within a method of that object
    + e.g., `self.state` in the `switch` method of the `Light` class

- The name `self` is a convention, but you can use any name you want
    + but it is _strongly_ recommended to stick to `self` for readability
    + the following class is equivalent to the `Light` class above, by simply renaming `self` to `this`:
        ```python
        class Light:
            def __init__(this, initially_on: bool):
                this.state = initially_on

            @property
            def is_off(this) -> bool:
                return not this.state

            # etc.
        ```

- You can imagine that variable self is _automatically_ passed to the method when it is called
    + e.g., `l.switch()` is equivalent to `Light.switch(l)`

            else:
                raise ValueError("Result is not a number: " + str(result))
        except Exception as e:
            expression = self.expression
            self.expression = ""
            raise ValueError("Invalid expression: " + expression) from e

## Encapsulation and Information Hiding

### What: [Encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming))

> The idea of presenting a _consistent interface_ [of an object, to its users] that is __independent__ of its _internal implementation_

### How: [Information Hiding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding)

> A means to achieve encapsulation, by __restricting/controlling__ access to the _internal_ details of an object

- Commonly achieved by separating how an object is __used__ from how it is _implemented_
    + e.g., by providing a _public_ interface, and _private_ implementation details

- Commonly involves enforcing some __invariants__ on the object's state
    + e.g., by ensuring that some attributes are _always_ in a certain range...
    + ... or that some attributes are _always_ consistent with each other

---

## Why Encapsulation Matters?

### Encapsulation helps to
- protect data from accidental modification
- ensure controlled access through defined methods
- improve maintainability by allowing internal implementation changes without affecting external usage
- create modular, reusable, and scalable code

### Example in real life
- a carâ€™s accelerator pedal: you control speed without directly modifying the engine parameters

## Example: Encapsulation in the `Light` class

Let's suppose that
- the intensity of the light bulb must be implemented as a __byte__ (`0` to `255`) where:
    + 0 means the light is off
    + 255 means the light is at its maximum intensity
- yet we may want the intensity to be _perceived_ as a __percentage__ (`0.0` to `100.0`) by the user
- the user may also want to have a _read-only_ __property__ to know if the light _is on_ (intensity > 0)
- the user should __not__ be able to go _beyond_ the `0â€”100%` range when setting the intensity
- switching the light on/off should work as follows:
    1. if the intensity is > 0, it should be set to 0
    2. if the intensity is 0, it should be set to the last value it had before being switched off
    3. the first time the light is switched on, intensity should be set to `100%`

---

## Example: Encapsulation in the `Light` class

```python
class Light:
    def __init__(self, initially_on: bool):
        self.__intensity: int = int(initially_on * 255)
        self.__last_intensity: int = 255
    
    @property
    def is_on(self) -> bool:
        return self.__intensity > 0

    @property
    def intensity(self) -> float:
        return self.__intensity / 255 * 100
    
    @intensity.setter
    def intensity(self, value: float):
        if not 0 <= value <= 100:
            raise ValueError("Intensity must be in the [0, 100] range")
        self.__intensity = int(value / 100 * 255)

    def switch(self):
        if self.__intensity > 0:
            self.__last_intensity = self.__intensity
            self.__intensity = 0
        else:
            self.__intensity = self.__last_intensity

    def to_string(self) -> str:
        return f"Light(intensity={self.__intensity})"
```

### Usage

```python
l = Light(initially_on=False)
print(l.to_string()) # Light(intensity=0)
l.intensity = 50
print(l.to_string()) # Light(intensity=127)
l.switch()
print(l.to_string()) # Light(intensity=0)
print(l.is_on)       # False
print(l.intensity)   # 0.0
l.switch()
print(l.to_string()) # Light(intensity=127)
l.intensity = 150    # ValueError: Intensity must be in the [0, 100] range
print(l.__intensity) # AttributeError: 'Light' object has no attribute '__intensity'
```

---
 
## Aspects to notice

- The `intensity` and `last_intensity` attributes are _private_ (i.e., their names start with `__`)
    + this means that they are _not_ accessible from outside the class
    + this is a way to enforce _information hiding_

- The technical detail "intensity is represented as a byte" is _hidden_ from the user
    + the user only sees the intensity as a percentage

- The invariant "intensity must be in the [0, 100] range" is _enforced_ by the setter of the `intensity` property
    + if the user tries to set an intensity outside this range, a `ValueError` is raised
    + as that's the _only_ way to set the intensity, the invariant is _always_ respected

## Identity and Equality

### Identity

- Two objects are _identical_ if they are the _same_ object in memory
    + i.e., if they have the _same_ memory address

- This is checked using the `is` operator
    + e.g., `a is b` returns `True` if `a` and `b` are the _same_ object

### Equality

- Two objects are _equal_ if they have the _same_ _value_
    + i.e., if their attributes are _recursively equal_

- This is checked using the `==` operator
    + yet, the operator only works if the object's class has a `__eq__` method which defines what equality means for that class

---

## Example: Complex Numbers

```python
class Complex:
    def __init__(self, real: float, imag: float):
        self.re = float(real)
        self.im = float(imag)

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return other is not None and hasattr(other, 're') and self.re == other.re and hasattr(other, 'im') and self.im == other.im
```

### Usage

{{% multicol %}}
{{% col %}}
```python
a = Complex(1, 2) # (1 + i * 2)
b = a
c = Complex(1, 2) # (1 + i * 2)

```

print(a == a) # True
print(a == b) # True
print(a == c) # True
print(a == d) # False
```
{{% /col %}}    
{{% /multicol %}}

---

## How to write good `__eq__` methods

1. No object is equal to `None` (`x == None` should always return `False`)
    - always check if the other object is `None`, returning `False` if it is
        + this is to avoid `NoneType` errors

2. Check whether the _other_ object is an instance of the same class of the current object
    - this is to avoid `AttributeError` errors
    - e.g., `isinstance(other, CurrentClass)` or `type(other) == type(self)` or `isinstance(other, type(self))`

2. Alternatively, check whether the _other_ object has the same attributes as the current object
    - this is to avoid `AttributeError` errors
    - e.g., `hasattr(other, 'attribute')` for each attribute of the current object that you want to compare

3. Compare the attributes of the _other_ object with the attributes of the current object
    - this is to define what equality means for the class
    - e.g., `self.attribute == other.attribute` for each attribute of the current object that you want to compare

---

## Example: Sets of Complex Numbers

```python
a = Complex(1, 2) # (1 + i * 2)
b = a
c = Complex(1, 2) # (1 + i * 2)
d = Complex(2, 1) # (2 + i * 1)

s = {a, b, c, d}
print(len(s)) # TypeError: unhashable type: 'Complex'
```

---

## Hashable objects

(cf. <https://www.pythonmorsels.com/what-are-hashable-objects/>)

- Long and complex discussion

- Put simply, you need objects to be __hashable__ in order for them to be used within a `set` or a `dict`

- An object is hashable if it has a `__hash__` method that returns a _semi-unique_ hash value for that object
    + a __hash value__ is an integer that is used to quickly compare objects
    + if two objects are equal, their hash values _must_ be the same
    + if two objects are _not_ equal, their hash values _should_ be different (but __collisions__ may occur)

### Rules of thumb for implementing the `__hash__` method

- Always implement the `__hash__` method if you implement the `__eq__` method (and _vice versa_)
- HOWTO: pass a __tuple__ to the `hash()` function, containing all and only the attributes that you compared in the `__eq__` method
    + e.g., `hash((self.attribute1, self.attribute2))`

---

## Example: Hashable Complex Numbers

```python
class Complex:
    def __init__(self, real: float, imag: float):
        self.re = float(real)
        self.im = float(imag)

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return other is not None and hasattr(other, 're') and self.re == other.re and hasattr(other, 'im') and self.im == other.im

    def __hash__(self):
        return hash((self.re, self.im))
```

```

{{% /multicol %}}

What's `<__main__.Complex object at 0x78d202e09520>`?

---

## Representing objects as strings

- By default, Python represents objects as `<package-name.ClassName object at 0x78d202e09520>`
    + this is the _memory address_ of the object in _hexadecimal_ notation

- Better would be to represent objects as strings that are _meaningful_ to the user
    + e.g., `Complex(1, 2)` instead of `<__main__.Complex object at 0x78d202e09520>`

- There are two more _magic methods_ to be implemented in Python classes, for the sake of string representation
    + `__str__`: returns a _user-friendly_ string representation of the object
    + `__repr__`: returns a _developer-friendly_ string representation of the object

- If `__str__` is not implemented, Python will use `__repr__` as a fallback
    + if `__repr__` is not implemented, Python will use the default representation
        * so better to implement them both, or at least just `__repr__`

- `__str__` is used by the `print()` and the `str()` functions, as well as in _f-strings_
    + e.g., `print(obj)` is equivalent to `print(str(obj))`, which is equivalent to `print(obj.__str__())`
    + e.g., `f"{obj}"` is equivalent to `f"{str(obj)}"`, which is equivalent to `f"{obj.__str__()}"`

- `__repr__` is used by the `repr()` function, as well as when the object is represented as part of a collection
    + e.g., `repr(obj)` is equivalent to `obj.__repr__()`
    + e.g., `f"{obj!r}"` is equivalent to `f"{obj.__repr__()}"`
    + e.g., `print([obj1, obj2, ...])` is equivalent to `print('[', obj1.__repr__(), ', ', obj2.__repr__(), ', ...]')`

---

## Repr vs. Str

Long and complex discussion, see: <https://realpython.com/python-repr-vs-str>

### Rules of thumb

1. `__repr__` should return a string that is _unambiguous_ and _complete_
    + i.e., it should be possible to _reconstruct_ the object from the string
    + e.g., `Complex(1, 2)` instead of `<__main__.Complex object at 0x78d202e09520>`

2. `__str__` should return a string that is _readable_ and _informative_
    + i.e., it should be _meaningful_ to the user
    + e.g., `1 + i * 2` instead of `Complex(1, 2)`

---

## Example: Presentable and Hashable Complex Numbers

```python
class Complex:
    def __init__(self, real: float, imag: float):
        self.re = float(real)
        self.im = float(imag)

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return other is not None and hasattr(other, 're') and self.re == other.re and hasattr(other, 'im') and self.im == other.im

    def __hash__(self):
        return hash((self.re, self.im))

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Complex({self.re}, {self.im})"
    
    def __str__(self):
        sign = '+' if self.im >= 0.0 else '-'
        im = abs(self.im)
        im = str(im) if im != 1.0 else ""
        return f"{self.re} {sign} i{im}" if self.im != 0.0 else str(self.re)

## Immutable vs. Mutable Objects (pt. 1)

- Objects are __immutable__ if their _state_ cannot be _changed_ after they are _created_
    + e.g., `int`, `float`, `str`, `tuple`, `frozenset`

- Objects are __mutable__ if their _state_ can be _changed_ after they are _created_
    + e.g., `list`, `dict`, `set`

- Immutability is a _good_ thing, as it makes objects _easier_ to reason about, and _safer_ to use
    + e.g., you can pass an immutable object to a function without worrying that it will be changed by that function

- Yet, immutability can be _inconvenient_ in some cases
    + e.g., data needs to be _updated_ in place, rather than _replaced_ by a new object

--- 

## Immutable vs. Mutable Objects (pt. 2)

> When designing a class, you should decide whether it should be _immutable_ or _mutable_ design

### How to achieve immutability

1. The attributes of an _immutable_ object should be _read-only_
    + i.e., they should be _set_ only in the constructor, and _never_ changed afterwards

2. The attributes of an _immutable_ object should be _immutable_ themselves
    + e.g., if an attribute is a `list`, it should be replaced by a `tuple`

3. State-changing methods should apply the __copy-on-write__ pattern
    + i.e., they should _not_ change the object's state, but return a _new_ object with the _updated_ state

### Suggestions

- Make classes _immutable_ by default, and _mutable_ only when necessary
    + this is a _good_ practice, as it makes the class _safer_ to use

- Alternatively, support both mutability and immutability
    + e.g., implement methods via the __copy-on-write__ pattern, but provide an optional parameter to _activate_ in-place updates

---

## Example: Immutable Complex Numbers

(cf. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number>)

```python
class Complex:
    def __init__(self, real: float, imag: float):
        self.re = float(real)
        self.im = float(imag)

    def add(self, other):
        return Complex(self.re + other.re, self.im + other.im)

    def subtract(self, other):
        return Complex(self.re - other.re, self.im - other.im)

    def multiply(self, other):
        return Complex(self.re * other.re - self.im * other.im, self.re * other.im + self.im * other.re)

    def divide(self, other):
        if other.re == 0 and other.im == 0:
            raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero: " + str(self))

### Usage

```python

b = Complex(-1, 1)

print(a.add(b))      # 2.0 + i3.0
print(a.subtract(b)) # 4.0 + i
print(a.multiply(b)) # -5.0 + i
print(a.divide(b))   # -0.5 - i2.5
```

## Example: Mutable Complex Numbers

```python
class Complex:
    def __init__(self, real: float, imag: float):
        self.re = float(real)
        self.im = float(imag)

    def add(self, other):
        self.re += other.re
        self.im += other.im

    def subtract(self, other):
        self.re -= other.re
        self.im -= other.im

    def multiply(self, other):
        re = self.re * other.re - self.im * other.im
        im = self.re * other.im + self.im * other.re
        self.re, self.im = re, im

    def divide(self, other):
        if other.re == 0 and other.im == 0:
            raise ZeroDivisionError("Cannot divide by zero: " + str(self))
        denominator = other.re ** 2 + other.im ** 2
        re = (self.re * other.re + self.im * other.im) / denominator
        im = (self.im * other.re - self.re * other.im) / denominator
        self.re, self.im = re, im

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return other is not None and hasattr(other, 're') and self.re == other.re and hasattr(other, 'im') and self.im == other.im

    def __hash__(self):
        return hash((self.re, self.im))

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Complex({self.re}, {self.im})"
    
    def __str__(self):
        sign = '+' if self.im >= 0.0 else '-'
        im = abs(self.im)
        im = str(im) if im != 1.0 else ""
        return f"{self.re} {sign} i{im}" if self.im != 0.0 else str(self.re)
```

(notice the lack of return statements)

### Usage

```python
a = Complex(3, 2)
b = Complex(-1, 1)

print(a.add(b))          # None
print(f'a={a}, b={b}')   # a=2.0 + i3.0, b=-1.0 + i
print(a.subtract(b))     # None
print(f'a={a}, b={b}')   # a=3.0 + i2.0, b=-1.0 + i
print(a.multiply(b))     # None
print(f'a={a}, b={b}')   # a=-5.0 + i, b=-1.0 + i
print(a.divide(b))       # None
print(f'a={a}, b={b}')   # a=3.0 + i2.0, b=-1.0 + i
```

(notice the lack of return values, and that `b` never changes while `a` does)

## Software Systems as Objects can interact with each other

- OOP software designer will model _interactions_ between objects

- To do so, they will design classes that _use_ other classes

- The __"single responsibility principle"__ suggests that each class should have _exactly one_ responsibility
    + so, if a class needs to interact with another class, it should _delegate_ that responsibility to the other class

- Good design is art: designers learn how _decompose_ a problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems...
    + ... assigning each sub-problem to a class, and _orchestrating_ the interactions between classes

---

## Example: The Complex Calculator

Let's say we want to design a __calculator__ that can compute arithmetic expressions of complex numbers
1. we design a class for representing _complex numbers_ (done!), encapsulating the _arithmetic operations' logic_
2. we design a class for representing a _complex calculator_ (to do), encapsulating the _orderly execution of expressions_
    + this one should use the former but not vice versa

```python
class ComplexCalculator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__memory = []
    
    def __memorize(self, value):
        self.__memory.append(value)

    def clear(self):
        self.__memory.clear()

    def number(self, value: int | float | Complex):
        if not isinstance(value, Complex):
            value = Complex(value, 0)
        self.__memorize(value)
    
    def operation(self, operator: str):
        if operator not in {'+', '-', '*', '/*'}:
            raise ValueError("Invalid operator: " + operator)
        self.__memorize(operator)

    def compute_result(self) -> Complex:
        if len(self.__memory) == 0:
            raise ValueError("Nothing to compute")
        result = self.__memory[0]
        for i in range(1, len(self.__memory), 2):
            operator = self.__memory[i]
            operand = self.__memory[i + 1]
            match operator:
                case '+':
                    result = result.add(operand)
                case '-':
                    result = result.subtract(operand)
                case '*':
                    result = result.multiply(operand)
                case '/':
                    result = result.divide(operand)
        self.clear()
        self.number(result)
        return result
```

### Usage

```python
c = ComplexCalculator()
c.number(3)
c.operation('+')
c.number(Complex(2, 1))
print(c.compute_result()) # 5.0 + i1.0
c.operation('*')
c.number(Complex(1, 1))
print(c.compute_result()) # 4.0 + i6.0
```

# Advanced OOP Topics

- __Inheritance__ to support _re-use_ and _specialization_ of classes
- __Polymorphism__ to support _flexibility_ and _encapsulation_

---

## The __Inheritance__ Mechanism

- Inheritance is a way to __reuse__ and _specialize_ classes, without _repeating_ code
    + a class can _inherit_ the attributes and methods of another class
    + the _inherited_ class is called the _base_, _parent_, or __super__ class
    + the _inheriting_ class is called the _derived_ or _child_ class, or __subclass__

- Inheritance is a way to __factorize__ common attributes and methods into a _base_ class
    + the _base_ class is a __generalization__ of the _derived_ class
    + the _derived_ class is a __specialization__ of the _base_ class

- Inheritance is a way to __extend__ the functionality of a class
    + the _derived_ class can __reuse__ old attributes of the _base_ class (without re-writing them)
    + the _derived_ class can __add__ new attributes to the _base_ class
    + the _derived_ class can __override__ the attributes of the _base_ class

- Inheritance creates a __sub-typing__ relationship between classes, which are subject to the [Liskov Substitution Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle)
    + i.e., an instance of a _derived_ class should be able to __substitute__ an instance of the _base_ class in any context 
        * (vice versa is not necessarily true)

### Examples

- `Animal` is a _base_ class, `Dog` and `Cat` are _derived_ classes
- `Shape` is a _base_ class, `Circle` and `Rectangle` are _derived_ classes
- `Vehicle` is a _base_ class, `Car` and `Bicycle` are _derived_ classes

---

## The __Inheritance__ Mechanism in Python

- In Python, a class can inherit from _one_ or _more_ classes
    + e.g., `class Derived(Base1, Base2, ...):`

- If no _base_ class is specified, the class _implicitly_ inherits from the `object` class
    + e.g., `class Derived:` is equivalent to `class Derived(object):`

- All classes are (either _directly_ or _indirectly_) derived from the `object` class
    + this is the _root_ of the class hierarchy in Python
    + i.e., all classes are __subtypes__ of the `object` class
        * recall that "everything is an object"

- Inside _derived_ classes, one can:
    + _reuse_ the attributes and methods of the _base_ class
    + _redefine_ (a.k.a. __override__) the attributes and methods of the _base_ class
    + _reuse_ the _old_ version of a method of the _base_ class, by calling `super()` instead of `self`

- Some classes are __abstract__, meaning that they are _incomplete_ and should not be instantiated
    + they are just meant to factorize common attributes and methods for the _derived_ classes

## Dummy Example: The `Animal` Class Hierarchy (v. 1)

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.__name: str = name       # private field

    @property
    def name(self) -> str:            # public, read-only property
        return self.__name

    def speak(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must override this method")
```

{{% multicol %}}
{{% col %}}
```python
class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print(f"[{self.name}]", "Woof!")
```
{{% /col %}}
{{% col %}}
```python
class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print(f"[{self.name}]", "Meow!")
```
{{% /col %}}
{{% col %}}
```python
class Crocodile(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print(f"[{self.name}]", "...")
```
{{% /col %}}
{{% /multicol %}}

```python
animals = [Dog("Rex"), Cat("Garfield"), Crocodile("Dingodile")]
for animal in animals:
    animal.speak()

# [Rex] Woof!
# [Garfield] Meow!
# [Dingodile] ...
```

Notice that all three classes:
- __inherit__ a _constructor_ from the base class, accepting the _name_ of the animal as a parameter
- __inherit__ the `name` property from the base class
- __inherit__, but __cannot access__, the `__name` field from the base class 
- __override__ the `speak` method from the base class
- _conventionally_ print the name of the animal before the sound it makes

---

## Private vs. Protected

- __Private__ attributes and methods are _not_ accessible from outside the class
    + they cannot be accessed from outside the class, _not even_ from the _derived_ classes
    + they are _inherited_ __but not accessible__ from the _derived_ classes

- __Private__ attributes are the ones whose names start (and does _not_ end) with `__`
    + e.g., `self.__name`
    + not to be confused with [magic methods](https://realpython.com/python-magic-methods/), whose names start _and end_ with `__`
        * e.g., `def __init__(self):`
        * these are _not_ private, but rather _special_, methods: override them only if you know what you are doing

- __Protected__ attributes and methods are _not_ accessible from outside the class, _but_ are accessible from the _derived_ classes
    + they are _inherited_ and _accessible_ from the _derived_ classes
    + they are the ones whose names start with `_`
    + e.g., `self._name`

- __Protected__ attributes can be used to factorize some functionality in a _base_ class, and _reuse_ it __only__ in the _derived_ classes

- __Public__ attributes and methods are _accessible_ from outside the class
    + non-private and non-protected attributes and methods are _public_ by default

---

## Dummy Example: The `Animal` Class Hierarchy (v. 2)

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.__name: str = name              # private field

    @property
    def name(self) -> str:                   # public, read-only property 
        return self.__name

    def _say_something(self, sound: str):    # protected method
        print(f"[{self.name}]", sound)

    def speak(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must override this method")
```

{{% multicol %}}
{{% col %}}
```python
class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        self._say_something("Woof!") 
```
{{% /col %}}
{{% col %}}
```python
class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        self._say_something("Meow!")
```
{{% /col %}}
{{% col %}}
```python
class Crocodile(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        self._say_something("...")
```
{{% /col %}}
{{% /multicol %}}

(the classes' behaviour is unchanged, see slide of [v. 1](#example-animal))

### Aspects to notice
- the base class `Animal` now has a _protected_ method `_say_something` to factorize the printing of the name before the sound...
- ... which is _reused_ by the _derived_ classes `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Crocodile`
- in this way the convention about printing the name before the sound is _made explicit_

---

## Dummy Example: The `Animal` Class Hierarchy (v. 3)


```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name: str, sound: str):
        self.__name: str = name      # private field
        self.__sound: str = sound    # private field

    @property
    def name(self) -> str:           # public, read-only property 
        return self.__name

    def speak(self):
        print(f"[{self.name}]", self.__sound)
```

{{% multicol %}}
{{% col %}}
```python
class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        super().__init__(name, sound="Woof!")
```
{{% /col %}}
{{% col %}}
```python
class Cat(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        super().__init__(name, sound="Meow!")
```
{{% /col %}}
{{% col %}}
```python
class Crocodile(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        super().__init__(name, sound="Meow!")
```
{{% /col %}}
{{% /multicol %}}

(the classes' behaviour is unchanged, see slide of [v. 1](#example-animal))

### Aspects to notice
- the `speak` method is now implemented once and for all in the base class `Animal`...
- ... and not overridden by the _derived_ classes `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Crocodile`
- the _base_ class `Animal` now has a _constructor_ that accepts the _name_ and the _sound_ of the animal
    + the sound is _memorized_ in a _private_ field, and _printed_ by the `speak` method
- derived classes `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Crocodile` _override_ the _constructor_ to _initialize_ the _sound_ of the animal
    + each derived class _specializes_ and _fixes_ the _sound_ of the animal, while the name is still _parametric_
- derived classes' overridden _constructors_ call the _base_ class' _constructor_ using `super()`
